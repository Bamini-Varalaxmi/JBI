### SPARC Core

Each SPARC core has hardware support for four threads. This support consists of a full register file (with eight register windows) per thread, with most of the address space identifiers (ASI), ancillary state registers (ASR), and privileged registers replicated per thread. The four threads share the instruction, the data caches, and the TLBs. Each instruction cache is 16 Kbytes with a 32-byte line size. The data caches are write through, 8 Kbytes, and have a 16-byte line size. The TLBs include an autodemap feature which enables the multiple threads to update the TLB without locking

Each SPARC core has single issue, six stage pipeline. These six stages are:

1.Fetch

2.Thread Selection

3.Decode

4.Execute

5.Memory

6.Write Back

Each SPARC core has the following units:

1.Instruction fetch unit (IFU) includes the following pipeline stages - fetch, thread selection, and decode. The IFU also includes an instruction cache complex.

2. Execution unit (EXU) includes the execute stage of the pipeline.

3. Load/store unit (LSU) includes memory and writeback stages, and a data cache complex.

4. Trap logic unit (TLU) includes trap logic and trap program counters. 5. Stream processing unit (SPU) is used for modular arithmetic functions for crypto. 6. Memory management unit (MMU).

7. Floating-point frontend unit (FFU) interfaces to the FPU.

### Instruction Fetch Unit

The thread selection policy is as follows - a switch between the available threads every cycle giving priority to the least recently executed thread. The threads become unavailable due to the long latency operations like loads, branch, MUL, and DIV, as well as to the pipeline stalls like cache misses, traps, and resource conflicts. The loads are speculated as cache hits, and the thread is switched-in with lower priority.

Instruction cache complex has a 16-Kbyte data, 4-way, 32-byte line size with a single ported

instruction tag. It also has dual ported (1R/1W) valid bit array to hold cache line state of valid/invalid. Invalidates access the V-bit array, not the instruction tag. A pseudo-random replacement algorithm is used to replace the cache line.

There is a fully associative instruction TLB with 64 entries. The buffer supports the following page sizes: 8 Kbytes, 64 Kbytes, 4 Mbytes, and 256 Mbytes. The TLB uses a pseudo least recently used (LRU) algorithm for replacement. Multiple hits in the TLB are prevented by doing an autodemap on a fill.

Two instructions are fetched each cycle, though only one instruction is issued per clock, which reduces the instruction cache activity and allows for an opportunistic line fill. There is only one outstanding miss per thread, and only four per core. Duplicate misses do not issue requests to the L2-cache.

The integer register file (IRF) of the SPARC core has 5 Kbytes with 3 read/2 write/1 transport ports. There are 640 64-bit registers with error correction code (ECC). Only 32 registers from the current window are visible to the thread. Window changing in background occurs under the thread switch. Other threads continue to access the IRF (the IRF provides a single-cycle read/write access).

### Execution Unit

The execution unit (EXU) has a single arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and shifter. The ALU is reused for branch address and virtual address calculation. The integer multiplier has a 5 clock latency, and a throughput of half-per-cycle for area saving. One integer multiplication is allowed outstanding per core. The integer multiplier is shared between the core pipe (EXU) and the modular arithmetic (SPU) unit on a round-robin basis. There is a simple non-restoring divider, which allows for one divide outstanding per SPARC core. Thread issuing a MUL/DIV will be rolled back and switched out if another thread is occupying the MUL/DIV units.

### Load/Store Unit

The data cache complex has an 8-Kbyte data, 4-way, 16-byte line size. It also has single ported data tag. There is a dual-ported (1R/1W) valid bit array to hold cache line state of valid or invalid. Invalidates access the V-bit array but not the data tag. A pseudo-random replacement algorithm is used to replace the data cache line. The loads are allocating, and the stores are non-allocating. The data TLB operates similarly to the instruction TLB.

The load/store unit (LSU) has an 8 entry store buffer per thread, which is unified into a single 32 entry array, with RAW bypassing. Only a single load per thread outstanding is allowed. Duplicate requests for the same line are not sent to the L2-cache. The LSU has interface logic to interface to the CPU-cache crossbar (CCX). This interface performs the following operations:

â– Prioritizes the requests to the crossbar for floating-point operation (Fpops), streaming operations. 15 and DS misses, stores and interrupts, and so on.

Request priority: imiss>Idmiss>stores, fpu,stream.interrupt).

Assembles packets for the processor-cache crossbar (PCX).

The LSU handles returns from the CPX crossbar and maintains the order for cache updates and invalidates.
